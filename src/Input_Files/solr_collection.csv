Information about sleeping habits and mosquito traps were collected at entomology visits to the participant's home, which occured every 2 weeks.; All variables were collected at the enrollment observation. At 24 hour and 48 hour follow-up observations, a few variables related to oxygen saturation were recollected for cases. At the 30 day follow-up observation, a few anthropometry variables were recollected for cases.; Children enrolled in the VIDA study were seen at an enrollment visit and at a 60 day follow-up visit. Additionally, diarrheal cases may have additional measurements taken repeatedly over the course of their health center or hospital stay; following rehydration and upon leaving the facility.",visittype;
